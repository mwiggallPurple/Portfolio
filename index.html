        <p class="aboutP">Hi, I’m Melissa.  I have a healthcare background but want to use my transferable skills to pivot into a career in Front-end Development.</p>
         <br/>
        <p class="aboutP">I started to develop an interest in web development in 2021 when I watched a YouTube video by Jake Wright called “Learn HTML in 12 minutes”.  It made me want to learn more so I used FreeCodeCamp for HTML & CSS before deciding I wanted to do a course with online tutor support & a certificate at the end (I do like a certificate).</p>
         <br/>   
        <p class="aboutP">I took an online bootcamp in January 2022 with Purple Beard Training who were providing Front-end bootcamps funded by the government to plug skill gaps in Tech & other industries.
         We studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React.js three evenings a week for 8 weeks & produced projects in groups using GitHub & agile methods.   We focused on writing clean code to build mobile first, responsive accessible websites in an agile environment.  We also learnt how to asynchronous programming to interact with REST API’s which I have used in my NASA daily photo project.</p>
         <br/>    </p>    
        <p class="aboutP">Since completing my bootcamp I have taught myself wireframing and how to use Figma to design a website using FreeCodeCamp.  I still use their material when I am solving coding problems along with my favorite YouTube channels Web Dev Simplified, Developedbyed, Kevin Powell and Programming with Mosh for JavaScript.  I have also completed a Level 2 in Understanding Coding this year.</p>
        <br/>    
        <p class="aboutP">After a bereavement I have taken a leave of absence from work to recover and I am now ready to re-enter the workplace & excited to get my first job in Tech.</p>
